Wanderinglabs Availability
================

Application that scrapes Reserve America according to queries provided by the end users. Looks for open campsites then notifies them via email.

Useful for when wanting to camp at a fully booked campground. If someone else cancels their reservation, this app will let you know so you may then book it.
